## Customization

### Adding New Podcasts
Edit the `podcasts` array in `App.js`:

```javascript
const podcasts = [
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "Your New Podcast",
    host: "Host Name",
    duration: "30 min",
    image: "https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg",
    category: "Your Category"
  }
];
```

### Changing Colors
Modify the color scheme in the `styles` object:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: '#0a0a0a', // Dark background
  },
  // ... other styles
});
```

### Adding Categories
Update the categories array in the Categories section:

```javascript
{['Technology', 'Wellness', 'Business', 'Arts', 'Science', 'Comedy', 'Your Category'].map((category) => (
  // ... category rendering
))}
```

## Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo** - Development platform and tools
- **React Hooks** - State management (useState)
- **StyleSheet** - Styling and layout
- **SafeAreaView** - Safe area handling for different devices

## Development Notes

- The app uses placeholder images from Unsplash
- All podcast data is currently static (no backend integration)
- The play/pause functionality is UI-only (no actual audio playback)
- Images are loaded from external URLs (ensure internet connection)

## Next Steps

To make this a fully functional podcast app, consider adding:

- Audio playback functionality (expo-av)
- Backend API integration
- User authentication
- Podcast search and filtering
- Favorites and playlists
- Push notifications
- Offline listening capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Image loading problems**: Check internet connection
3. **Build errors**: Ensure Node.js version compatibility
4. **Expo Go connection**: Make sure device and computer are on same network
